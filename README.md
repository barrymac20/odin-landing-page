Odin Project - Recipes Project

This is the second project on the "Odin Project" foundations course and will help me put what I've learned so far about HTML, CSS (particularly Flexbox) into practice. The project consists of creating a webpage that will eventually match the design provided in the course. By the time this project is complete I hope to have been able to demonstrate the following skills:

Create HTML file with appropriate elements and classes to ensure the layout matches the design
Create CSS file that will style the webpage and match the design
Use Flexbox to create the appropriate layout
